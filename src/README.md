## Project Description : 

Bank of Flatiron

Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron! Our mission is to provide you with a secure and convenient platform to manage all your financial needs. With our user-friendly interface and robust security measures, you can trust us with your sensitive financial data. Below is a guide on how to use our app effectively.

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.

If you are unfamiliar with HTML tables, take a look at the docs with an example hereLinks to an external site.


As a user, I should be able to:

See a table of the transactions.
Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should display the new transaction to the table no persistence mechanism is needed for this.
Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
